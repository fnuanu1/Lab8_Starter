How are service workers and graceful degradation related?
- Both aim to keep the app functional even when advanced features aren’t available.
- Graceful degradation starts with full tech (JS, CSS) and works down gracefully.
Service workers add features like offline support and caching — but the app still works if they fail or aren't supported.
- Together, they help build more resilient and accessible web apps on/offline.
