How are service workers and graceful degradation related?
- Both aim to keep the app functional even when advanced/specific features aren’t available.
- Graceful degradation works down gracefully so we want to have some functionality and keep adding more tedious things so service workers add features like offline support and caching — so the app still works if they fail or aren't supported. Together, they help build more resilient and accessible web apps on/offline.
